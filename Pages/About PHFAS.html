            HEALTH 360 
        </aside>  
            <p class="asidep">Health 360 is a holistic approach to health and well-being that considers all aspects of an individual's life. Instead of focusing solely on physical health, 
            it takes into account various dimensions, including mental, emotional, social, and even spiritual aspects. The idea is to address health in a comprehensive and
            integrated manner, recognizing that these different dimensions are interconnected and can impact each other.

By 360-degree approach, individuals aim to create a balanced and sustainable lifestyle that promotes overall health and well-being.
This perspective emphasizes that health is not just the absence of illness but involves actively cultivating a state of flourishing across various dimensions of life.
